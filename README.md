## 📂 Step 2: Choose Your Wrap Type

Identify which type of wrap you are adding and follow the specific instructions below.

| Wrap Type | For Who? | Requirement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Donation Wraps** | Individual Players | Requires Donation Points. |
| **Organisation Wraps** | Groups, Gangs, Squads | For official organisations. |

## 👤 Option A: Donation Wraps (Players)

Wraps for individual users must follow a strict **username** and **sequential number** format.

### 1. Create the Folder Structure
Inside your forked repo (using GitHub Desktop or the web), navigate to: `RPGvehicleWrapAssets/wraps/custom/users/`

1.  Find or create a folder with your **exact username** (e.g., `ronseal`).
2.  Inside your user folder, create a new folder using the next **sequential number**.
    * *Example:* If `001` exists, name the new folder `002`.

**Example Path:**
`RPGvehicleWrapAssets/wraps/custom/users/ronseal/001/`

### 2. Add Required Files
Inside your numbered folder (e.g., `001`), add the following:

* **`wrap.png`** (Required)
    * The image file **must** be strictly named `wrap.png`.
    * Do not use other names (like `car.png` or `Wrap.png`).

* **`allowed.txt`** (Optional)
    * Create this file to restrict access.
    * List allowed SAES usernames, one per line.
    * *If omitted, the wrap is public.*

    **Example (`allowed.txt`):**
    ```text
    ronseal
    nanobob
    brophy
    ```

## 🏢 Option B: Organisation Wraps

Wraps for organisations are stored by organization type (gang, squad, group, etc.).

### 1. Navigate to the Folder
Inside your forked repo, navigate to: `RPGvehicleWrapAssets/wraps/custom/orgs/`

1.  Open the folder matching your organization type (e.g., `group`, `gang`, `squad`).
2.  **Do NOT create a sub-folder.** You simply drop the image file directly into this type folder.

**Example Path:**
`RPGvehicleWrapAssets/wraps/custom/orgs/group/`

### 2. Add Required Files
* **`<orgname>.png`** (Required)
    * The image file should be named after your organization (e.g., `soa.png`, `bope.png`).
    * *Note: Organisation wraps do not use `allowed.txt`.*

## 📤 Step 3: Submit Your Wrap

Once you have added your files to your forked repository:

1.  **Commit & Push:** Save your changes using GitHub Desktop (or your preferred tool) with a descriptive message.
    * *Example:* `Added wrap: ronseal/001` or `Added org wrap: soa.png`.
2.  **Open a Pull Request:**
    * Go to the "Pull Requests" tab in the original `SAESRPG/vehicle-wraps` repository.
    * Click **New Pull Request**.
    * Select your fork and submit.

## ✅ General Rules

* **File Format:** All images must be in **.PNG** format.
* **File Naming:**
    * **Users:** Must be `wrap.png`.
    * **Orgs:** Must be `orgname.png`.
* **Content:** Designs must comply with SAESRPG community guidelines.
